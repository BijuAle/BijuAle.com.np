Dear Astha,

We completed our activities for the day and distributed the Agriculture Infographic calendar to 56 households in Pipal Dada. Kristian was not able to join us. He had diarrhea last night and also needed time to recover from yesterday’s demanding work at Fajimtar School, where we were removing stones from the schoolyard. He rested today and is feeling fine now. It was nothing serious. Johan is still recovering as well, so he did not join us either. The rest of us, including me, left for the field at 8 am and returned at 2 pm. As mentioned yesterday, we carried snacks with us, including bananas, noodles, crackers, cucumbers, and water.

Overall, today went well. Ksitiz mentioned that Johan is feeling much better and is looking forward to joining us for tomorrow’s activity at Panchaling School, where we will be cleaning and decorating the premises. The finance representative from AN called to inform me that the supplies for tomorrow have been procured. I requested that they be delivered to the school by this evening, and they agreed. I will follow up to confirm the delivery, as well as check on the plantation supplies. They were unable to provide self standing ladders and suggested that we use locally available ladders instead, which should be manageable. Most of the required materials have been arranged, including paints, brushes, masks, and gloves. They also provided some additional useful items such as paraffin oil and sandpaper. I believe we are well prepared.

I understand that you have sent the medical kit along with the water purification supplies to Tassia and Ankit. Thank you for that. I have informed everyone about the group photo. It has been difficult to arrange one since we are working in different locations with separate plans, making it hard to gather at the same time. However, I will make it a priority to take the group photo as soon as we are all together, possibly during a shared activity or even sooner if possible. Tassia is doing well, although she needs rest after today’s long hike in the intense heat. We made sure to take adequate breaks along the way. She mentioned that she would benefit from including more protein in her diet. Kristian and I were unable to take a shower today because our host family is currently cleaning and repairing the water source. They informed us that it will be ready by tomorrow and that they will also arrange a tarpaulin covering for the open bathing area.

Everything else is going well, Astha. I hope our friends at Fajimtar are also doing well.

Regards,
Biju
