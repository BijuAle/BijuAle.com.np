# ABOUT

![Biju and group in Dhading](./biju.png)

My name is _Biju Ale_. I am a John 3:16 Christian. I am interested in Philosophy, Science, and Theology. Welcome to my website, where I try to write about my formative experiences and occasional musings.

Presently, I support a consulting firm called [Scott Wilson Nepal](https://swnepal.com.np/biju-ale/), in research, monitoring, learning, and evaluation of myriad developmental projects.
