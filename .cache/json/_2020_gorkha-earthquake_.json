However, the Gorkha earthquake has rendered additional dynamics and an urgency to eliminate threats to humanitarian efforts involving foreign stakeholders. As evidenced above in the discussions of disaster diplomacy, it is high time that the government of Nepal look into establishing a dedicated think tank that can produce incisive analyses for subtle maneuvering to wrangle the vested interest of foreign stakeholders while expunging its own. The intellectual bodies must inform Nepalese foreign policy to discern altruism-clad aid from national interests, thus mitigating the potential for subtle exploitation of disaster scenarios. Furthermore, it must strive to entirely detach aid handling over any political rancors.
