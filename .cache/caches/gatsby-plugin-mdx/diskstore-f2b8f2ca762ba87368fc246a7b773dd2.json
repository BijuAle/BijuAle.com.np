Brother Yubaraj Gajmer, then GESI officer in SAMATA had invited me to the event where Bhattachan was one of the keynote speakers. Other speakers included CK Lal, the veteran political analyst; Chaitanya Mishra, the professor of sociology at Tribhuvan University; and others. At the end of the session during tea, I encountered him for an ad-lib exchange. I wanted to know how the Nepalese academia is influenced by Hinduism, the major worldview of the Nepalese also and what his personal worldview was.

He agrees that there exists the gap of the philosophical engagement in academic discourses in Nepal. Like Yubaraj notes, Bhattachan is quite amiable and well-spoken. His academic prominence does not hinder his engagement with a layperson. Despite some of the shortcomings in his reasoning, he was among the most friendly and honest Nepalese intellectuals to talk to. It was an illuminating exchange to get a sociologist's perspective on the current landscape of Nepalese academia, the influence of Hinduism, the need for transcending boundaries, and to know about Bhattachan's own worldview. Some of his interesting anecdotes from his Berkely days, his fear that humans are going to be displaced by machines, and field visits on the Red Indian culture were informative, `}{`&`}{` amusing.`}</p>\n    <iframe width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/808903924%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-R3eWEEkmoPJ&color=%230f1f4a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
