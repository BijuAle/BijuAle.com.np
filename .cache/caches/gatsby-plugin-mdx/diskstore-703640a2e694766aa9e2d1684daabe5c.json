He was a household name within our family, and we owned several of his albums in cassettes and discs. Das has been a distinguished musician loved ubiquitously by the Nepalese. Millennials will have special sentiment with his song \"Jindagi Ko Ke Bharosa\" — a gem of a Nepali song. I revere Das not only for his soothing timbre, and his top-notch vocal finesse but also for his powerful songwriting. His lyrics, rare of its kind in the Nepali music industry are distinctly philosophical. Das does not dwell in the cliché romantic love-songs prevalent in Nepali pop music. Rather he pens poignant words reminding the listeners of grand existential questions while emanating hope to plow through life's ordeals, garnering beauty and meaning in the process.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Today, out of curiosity I queried him in Wikipedia. To my dismay, I discovered Karina Das had a malformed article only little more than a stub. The previous wiki page author skipped a large significant portion of Das's legacy and contribution to the Nepalese music scene. I took it upon my own hands to revise, edit, and expand the old wiki article. I watched several interviews with Karna Das and dug through the archives of Himalayan Times - a national Nepali daily, and Nepali Times - an English weekly to probe into Das's musical journey from childhood through his heyday, unto his hiatus and the status quo. I prepared a draft wiki article, and after negotiating \"neutrality\" in my tone with Ed6767, wiki's moderator, my article was published. Here, I would like to some noteworthy part from my updated article.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"introduction\"\n    }}>{`Introduction`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Karna Das is a Nepali musician, songwriter, lyricist, composer, and record producer. Das was born on 24 November, 1974 in Pokhara, considered a beautiful city of lakes and home to three of the highest peaks in the world.`}</p>\n    <p>{`He completed high school in 1993, completed his Intermediate of Arts (IA) in Education, and studied economics in college. Das was also the lead singer of the band Madhyanha (translated - central point). He started his singing career in 1997 with the band's first song, entitled \"Jindagi Ko Ke Bharosa\". Das wrote the song himself, when he was 20 years old.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Das plays piano, guitar, and bass guitar. His musical inspirations include Elton John, Richard Michael, Scorpions, Michael Jackson, Gulam Ali of Pakistan, Lata Mangeshkar and the Ghazal singer Jagjit Singh of India, and Narayan Gopal of Nepal.`}</p>\n    <p>{`He is revered for his soothing and melodious voice and also for his distinct songwriting spanning philosophical and existential issues of mankind, perseverance, hope, and patriotism.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"early-life\"\n    }}>{`Early life`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Das was born and raised in an art-loving, and musical Christian home. He is the only son and has an elder and a younger sister. His father played Tabla and was a singer, but could not continue the music after he joined the Indian Army. His mother Ratna Devi Das was a professional dancer. She was a chorus line dancer, and also performed alongside the Bollywood actress Mala Sinha, in the 1966 Nepali movie, Maitighar.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Das was educated in Sunday School in his Church in Pokhara from early childhood to adolescence where he garnered his moral and musical lessons. Growing up in a Christian home, music was intimately part of the family, as they sang and played along Christian hymns, gospels, and worship songs. Das learned the fundamentals of music in his church singing in the choir. He recalls as a young 12-year-old, he was gifted by his mother, his first acoustic guitar, and was encouraged to pursue music. He was given guitar lessons by a guitar teacher named Manish Tamang in his village. Observing Das's incessant love for music and his promising talent, his mother nudged him into a disciplined musical learning path, grooming and guiding young Das.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the milieu of Nepal's bucolic livelihood, raising and shepherding cattle and sheep was part of Das's regular chore. He recalls the only medium for music in his village was the radio. As a teenager, the first western music Das got antiquated to was Holiday by the German rock band Scorpions, which grabbed him in astonishment. He was soon into sentimental and melodious English tunes shared with him by his friend Arjun. Das was fascinated by Elton John songs, and hits of Michael Jackson such as Earth Song, and Heal The World.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As Das's father joined the Indian Army, the family moved to New Delhi where Das was introduced to Indian songs. He craved for lyrically strong music and that was beyond merely psychologically pleasure-inducing. His inspiration met with Pakistani singer Gulam Ali, and the Indian Ghazal giant Jagdish Singh. Das was particularly touched by the Urdu lexicon which was distinctly soaked with sentiment and meaning, and had a wide gamut of diverse and subtle connotations. Das wanted to emulate this aspect of Eastern language through the Nepali songwriting and vocabulary.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Moreover, he also attributes his study of the Bible and philosophical books which gave him the perspective for life's reality that would influence his writings. Das garnered a holistic taste for western, Indian, and Nepali songs that especially packed meaningful depth and sentiment. At the age of 19, he began percolating his experience into carving and drafting original words and melodies simultaneously. He would soon take the Nepali musical scene with storm, through his beautiful, soul-stirring, and powerful music.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"personal-life\"\n    }}>{`Personal life`}</h1>\n    <p>{`He is married to Sima Das. He has 3 sons. During, the thick of the civil war in Nepal known as the Maoist insurgency, Das released a couple of albums targeting the listeners of the war-stuck nation. Through his music, he asked his listeners to persist their hope, and bolster their perseverance until everyone meets the impending light at the end of the tunnel. To the then bastions of power through his songs, he urged that the struggle of Nepalese was not merely the radical changes in power structures, but for the grassroot upliftment of people's life and livelihoods. An example is evinced in the song \"Thula Thula Mahal\" which voices Nepalese preference for tiny huts that imparts vocation and education rather than tall indifferent urban complexes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In 2005, Das took a decade-long hiatus from the musical activity in Nepal, during which he resided in the United States. The aftermath of April 2015 Nepal earthquake, invoked the urgency for ensuring the well-being of his family, thus he made the repatriate. Assessing in retrospect, Das considers his life's journey including the hiatus as carefully planned and worked out by God. He considers the almighty pulled him through the highs and lows with a purpose — to teach Das life lessons of immense significance, and to seep in him deeper perspective into reality, which he would not have garnered otherwise. As of now, he is glad to be reunited and to cherish love, with his family and grown children. In 2016, he resumed his music in Nepal, and catering to his life-long fans, released the album \"Euta Naya Asha\" (A New Hope).`}</p>\n    <p>{`Das is a devoted Christian and believes Jesus Christ of Nazareth as his lord and savior, and the hope for the world.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"awards\"\n    }}>{`Awards`}</h1>\n    <p>{`In the pre 90s era, the artists in Nepal were only supported by the state-owned radio station - Radio Nepal. With the advent of private stations in the 90s, budding artists gained wider options for performance platform, and quality appraisal of their work. Hits FM and Image FM awards as succh were premium accolades for a Nepali musician. Nepal Times, an English weekly states regarding these awards: \"...widely regarded as the most representative Nepali awards: the people decide on the nominees, and an independent panel of judges culled from the pillars of Nepali musicmake the final selection.\"`}</p>\n    <p>{`Das has won over two dozen awads since 1997.
