While this mostly works very well, ignoring the right hemisphere of our brains means we fail to tap into the huge potential source of creativity, ideas and connections that the more logical left side might not offer. Mind maps helped to bridge both parts of the brain. The powerful idea would just stimulate both sides of the brain.

Chakrapani Timislina the field-based program officer was of immense help to answer all the queries I had. From the initial days, he had been of great help while he was in travelling to Kathmandu. After I studied the local subsidy contracts, it was clear that selected actors from private, public and cooperative sectors were technically and partially assisted by our team. Similarly, among the five components of the programme, we focused on output C+D. During the discussion with Chakrapani, I was made clear how we focus on meeting indicators of our plan working among private and cooperative sector and their respective organizations the FNCCI, FNCSI and NCF.`}</p>\n    <p>{`At certain times, I may have asked some of the obvious questions, but ultimately it helped me clear out any misconceptions. In addition, confusions with names of the district and municipal chambers of FNCCI and district chapters of FNCSI were cleared by Punam. Likewise, I was able to understand how other bodies fit into the partner structure as implementing organizations in national, district levels with specific roles in governance.`}</p>\n    <p>{`More importantly, for our side of documentation, I worked on finalizing reports that included extracting only the required data and properly organizing it.

However, the company of colleagues was nice to have.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The next day, Bhatta took me to Rupedia, the market place bordering India. I could experience what it is like in the Indo-Nepal borders. The boundary there was virtually blurred and the bustling traders and locals would pass the seemingly makeshift checkpoints. I heard the police bribery to smuggle extra commodoties in Nepal was rampant there. Though, we did not linger at the border to witness one. The market was fairly big one. Customers were mostly interested in the daily consumables, k, kitchenware, vegetables, fruits and, clothing items which. The rates are quite low compared to the Nepali market otherwise appended by the transportation and import duties.

To exemplify, some things considered axiomatic were not so obvious as it seemed because everything was new to me. Be it, experiencing your first recallable flight where knowing the routine operations of airport beforehand was crucial.
