He reads, repeats and memorizes until having convinced himself into a comfortable association with the word. As though a dictionary lookup will make you an instant expert on the word; like flipping a light switch from off to on.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Vocabulary researchers have proposed a better metaphor for the right way of learning words - the dimmer-switch phenomenon. A smart switch which can intensify the light, with the knob’s turn. We first learn the dictionary definition, & gradually become comfortable with its usage in various contexts; next, we draw figurative parallels, dissect its morphemes, & go on to store the word in our mental schema.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Obtaining deep, rich, immortal, & nuanced vocabulary never comes simply by persistently mugging up dictionary definitions. This ineffective method of ‘one-word-per-instance’, prevalent in most schools leads to a peripheral knowledge & memory lasting no longer than until the quiz due next Friday or until aptitude tests like SATs.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"framework-for-vocabulary\"\n    }}>{`Framework for Vocabulary`}</h1>\n    <p>{`In contrast to the traditional way of definitional vocabulary learning, 5 core principles that I learnt from experience & long hours of research & that I am currently employing in my self-learning, has provided me with the reliable framework for building a better vocabulary. On its face value, the principles read learning definition; knowing the words in its context, drawing personal connections by considering ‘new’ words as labels for ‘known’ concepts of life; understanding the word’s etymology & morphology; & finally semantic groupings in the mental schema.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As I delve deeper into improving my vocabulary, with this 5 principled approach, I am in limerence with English as the language & am ever appreciative of its beauty. It has the ability to absorb from other languages & to evolve to make speech succinct & reflective of reality. A handful from the interesting words I encountered were 'factotum', 'procrustean', 'gadfly', 'Hornswoggle', 'mountebank', 'ersatz', and 'canoodle'. Moreover, I learned to refract shades of meanings of synonymous words, often thought to allow swapping usage, for example, between 'specious' & 'spurious'.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Additionally, I learned to understand words in their context & in connection with my own happenings in life. Narrative etymologies of words fascinated me, maintaining my persistent interest in learning new words.

Reading here means digging through that new word.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you research (try Google's Ngram viewer) on the occurrence of any English word in print, you discover that its first usage marks (most of the time) circa 1600.

Just as marine biologists wanting to research sharks, do so not in isolation, but in its natural habitat - the ocean, in the same token, a word must be studied in its natural habitat. Words reside in phrases, sentences, paragraphs, & books. Example usage of words in a sentence will edify you on the scope of its habitat, outside which it could suffocate to death.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Become a voracious reader of quality materials. Not all books slapped 'best seller' are interesting. Some of them are crap. The key is to to be highly selective of what you read. Don't read books just because it is making headlines. Read on something that interests you. And research what classics have been produced. Go through GoodReads.com. Exchange book reviews with your best friends while you encourage them to read more.

Dawkins, Harris, Dennet, & Hitchens, sometimes sound like sophists with their specious arguments against God's existence. And so on. One way I connected with the word 'factotum' is through Alfred, Batman's loyal butler. For me, he is the paradigm of a factotum.
