I revere Das not only for his soothing timbre, and his top-notch vocal finesse but also for his powerful songwriting. His lyrics, rare of its kind in the Nepali music industry are distinctly philosophical. Das does not dwell in the clich\\xE9 romantic love-songs prevalent in Nepali pop music.

I watched several interviews with Karna Das and dug through the archives of Himalayan Times - a national Nepali daily, and Nepali Times - an English weekly to probe into Das's musical journey from childhood through his heyday, unto his hiatus and the status quo.

To the then bastions of power through his songs, he urged that the struggle of Nepalese was not merely the radical changes in power structures, but for the grassroot upliftment of people's life and livelihoods.
