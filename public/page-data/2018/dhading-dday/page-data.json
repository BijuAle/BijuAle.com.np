We demarcated the land & identified plant species that can reduce landslides there. Initially, there was some issue with getting hold of the ActionNepal contact for yesterday\\u2019s activity. He was misnomered in the contact list we were given. But we did the task ourselves anyways & it went very well. We also talked to the principle and discussed another future activity in the school, the class decoration & cleaning. Then in the evening, we had a meeting at my home & we sent an order list of materials to ActionNepal for plantation & class decoration (paints, protective gear, etc) activities. Ganesh ji responded by saying he would get back to me after talking to his team today early morning. But I received no response. I called him later today & he said that AN is trying to procure our orders but he says not all items will be available for us. He said some plant saplings like the fruit-bearing trees (mango, peach, litchi) will not be provided. We were sad to hear this because we had a robust plan to include many locally suitable plants to reduce landslide. However, they said we will only be provided 2 species of plants. Lastly, he said he will get back to us & the Fajimtar group with our order status.

But today we met them & helped them with their school cleaning pre-activity. It was hard work to remove the stones from the premise ground to make it safe for the kids. Jacqueline did well managing today\\u2019s task. She is extra concerned when it comes to school related activities. She including us were quite surprised when AN people at the HQ and at the field did not correspond to us so well, in managing logistics & giving us timely updates.

Tassia, I, & Kristian are desperately in need of shower. We are smelling & dirty but need to go early tomorrow morning for another round of distribution. So, we will only shower later tomorrow.
