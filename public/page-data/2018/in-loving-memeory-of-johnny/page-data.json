Circa 2010, they returned to Denmark. However, they could not bring Johnny with them. Johnny was always fond of my mother and would gravitate towards wherever she went.

We had lots of fun playing together and enjoying together myriad delicacies from delis to pizza. In the winter I would tuck her cozy on my bed next to me at night. When we shifted to Budhanilkantha, she had less space to play around but we would take her for a walk every day. Johnny would everyday anticipate us near the door when it was time for us to get back home from work and school. I can testify for Rupert Sheldrake when he mounts a scientific case for a 6th sense-like connection between us and our pets, in his book - 'Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home: And Other Unexplained Powers of Animals'. As we opened the door, Johnny would spring at us to lick us and she would run around the house with ecstasy. From an early age, she had very good manners.
