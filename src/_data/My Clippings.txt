In this context, it is important to realize that, while critical theories come in various forms—race, gender, queer, postcolonial, and so forth—they all share certain things in common, most notably the view that claims to truth are ultimately manipulative.

define wokeness as critical consciousness to intersecting systems of oppression. Specifically, to be a woke person is to hold an unretractable embodied consciousness and political identity acknowledging the oppression that exists in individual and collective experiences. As womxn of color with hxrstories [sic] of colonization, our oppressors work to keep us blinded, silenced, and complacent with inequities of power by claiming a post-racist and post-sexist America. We argue that for womxn of color to be woke is to hold capital against an oppressive system by articulating the system’s existence. A woke womxn does not have to possess the language to name oppression, but rather know of oppression and reject its unjust nature.

Figure 1. Critical social theory (or critical theory) is an umbrella category encompassing various critical social theories (or critical theories) like critical race theory and queer theory. Contemporary critical theory is the term we use to describe the ideas unifying these theories today. Although they are very influential and are informed by critical social theory, critical social justice and antiracism are not included in this figure, since they are not technically critical social theories.

Marx believed that history unfolds as a series of struggles between opposing social groups, one of whom controls the “means of production.” Historical events and technological progress have led various economic systems to evolve, but always in a way that reproduces the stratification of society into the ruling class (those who own/control the means of production) and the working class. Marx theorized that capitalism itself was a temporary stage in social development that would eventually give rise to communism, after workers finally took control of the means of production and ushered in a classless utopia.

First, they reaffirmed Marx’s commitment to “liberation” and “emancipation” from oppressive social conditions.27 Second, they believed this goal was intimately linked to a perpetual critique of the status quo and with skepticism toward universal prescriptions and solutions. Third, they expanded Marx’s understanding of oppression significantly, recognizing that it could not be reduced to or traced back to economic arrangements. They critiqued not just various modes of production, but the “culture industry,” mass media, conformity, and other mechanisms by which modern nations limited human potential. Finally, like Marx and later theorists, many of the members of the Frankfurt School saw the destruction of the nuclear family and the eradication of traditional sexual morality as crucial to human liberation. In particular, Marcuse’s Eros and Civilization announced that “the only way for human beings to escape the one-dimensionality of advanced industrial society is to rebel against ‘technological rationality’ (i.e., the repressive values of capitalist morality), and to liberate our erotic side, our sensuous instincts.”

Marcuse’s key contribution to Marxism was his incorporation of Freudian psychoanalytical themes into a revolutionary program. He expanded the base for social revolution to include not only oppressed workers (an economic factor), but also those considered to be sexual or social deviants no matter what their economic class (a cultural factor), and those in minority groups (a racial factor). Thus, he called for homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals, and those in other nontraditional sexual categories to join the revolution against the capitalist-traditional-family status quo. In Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud, a 1959 bestseller, he writes that the body can be freed from monogamous constraints to find full erotic experience.39 Marcuse called for a “polymorphous” sexuality—one not limited by bourgeoise traditions of repression.

For Marcuse, “a one-dimensional man” is anesthetized by material comforts and the blandishments of technological society. He must be roused from his capitalist torpor in order to discern his underlying discontent. Marcuse strained to explain Marx’s failed prophecy that the struggle between the bourgeois and proletariat would lead to revolution by claiming that “technological rationality” had somehow tamed the workers to make an unacknowledged pact with the owners. Now Marcuse would rip open the wound and reveal the disease.

Few of these ideas have proven more pernicious than those of the so-called Frankfurt School and its reactionary philosophy of “critical theory.” At once overly intellectualized and emotionally juvenile, Critical Theory—like Pandora’s Box—released a horde of demons into the American psyche. When everything could be questioned, nothing could be real, and the muscular, confident empiricism that had just won the war gave way, in less than a generation, to a fashionable Central European nihilism that was celebrated on college campuses across the United States. Seizing the high ground of academe and the arts, the new nihilists set about dissolving the bedrock of the country, from patriotism to marriage to the family to military service.
