Christianity is not just about rules and laws, but rules and laws decreed by God have been a fact of life since the day of creation. So if we define guilt as that which a person incurs when he violates a law, we incur supreme guilt when we break the law of God. That is because His law is perfect. It is never arbitrary. It does not reflect merely the vested interests of a particular lobby group, but the perfect, holy, righteous character of God Himself.",

        "content": "Most people use the terms morality and ethics interchangeably. Technically, morality refers to the actual content of right and wrong, and ethics refers to the process of determining, or discovering, right and wrong. In other words, morality deals with moral knowledge and ethics with moral reasoning and justification. Thus, ethics is both an art and a science. It does involve precision like the sciences, but like art, it is an inexact and sometimes intuitive discipline. Morality is the end result of ethical deliberation, the substance of right and wrong.",

There are three primary deontological systems: (1) divine command theory, (2) natural law, and (3) ethical rationalism. Christians tend to be more deontologically oriented because of the emphasis in Christian ethics on the commands of God as moral absolutes and guiding principles. But Christian ethics have a substantial place for virtue ethics too, since a major part of the Christian moral life involves emulating the character traits of Christ and exemplifying the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:13–24).",

Third, they expanded Marx’s understanding of oppression significantly, recognizing that it could not be reduced to or traced back to economic arrangements. They critiqued not just various modes of production, but the “culture industry,” mass media, conformity, and other mechanisms by which modern nations limited human potential. Finally, like Marx and later theorists, many of the members of the Frankfurt School saw the destruction of the nuclear family and the eradication of traditional sexual morality as crucial to human liberation. In particular, Marcuse’s Eros and Civilization announced that “the only way for human beings to escape the one-dimensionality of advanced industrial society is to rebel against ‘technological rationality’ (i.e., the repressive values of capitalist morality), and to liberate our erotic side, our sensuous instincts.”",

He expanded the base for social revolution to include not only oppressed workers (an economic factor), but also those considered to be sexual or social deviants no matter what their economic class (a cultural factor), and those in minority groups (a racial factor). Thus, he called for homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals, and those in other nontraditional sexual categories to join the revolution against the capitalist-traditional-family status quo. In Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud, a 1959 bestseller, he writes that the body can be freed from monogamous constraints to find full erotic experience.39 Marcuse called for a “polymorphous” sexuality—one not limited by bourgeoise traditions of repression.",
