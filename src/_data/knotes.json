Third, they expanded Marx’s understanding of oppression significantly, recognizing that it could not be reduced to or traced back to economic arrangements. They critiqued not just various modes of production, but the “culture industry,” mass media, conformity, and other mechanisms by which modern nations limited human potential. Finally, like Marx and later theorists, many of the members of the Frankfurt School saw the destruction of the nuclear family and the eradication of traditional sexual morality as crucial to human liberation. In particular, Marcuse’s Eros and Civilization announced that “the only way for human beings to escape the one-dimensionality of advanced industrial society is to rebel against ‘technological rationality’ (i.e., the repressive values of capitalist morality), and to liberate our erotic side, our sensuous instincts.”",
