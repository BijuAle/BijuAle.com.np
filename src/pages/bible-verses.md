Please be mindful that reading these bible verses in isolation can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.  I encourage you to delve deeper into the surrounding passages of these verses. As Greg Koukl reminds us, "Never read a bible verse!" Bible verses aren’t stand-alone quotations or sayings that you suit your meaning and feelings into; they’re part of a unified Scripture, the living Word of God, woven from history, prophecy, literature, and episteles.

These are my favorite verses (for their context please refer to a good commentary on the verse).
