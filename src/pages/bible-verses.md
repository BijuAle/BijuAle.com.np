Greg Koukl has taught us an invaluable, wise, and critical advice: never read just one Bible verse!  Bible verses aren’t isolated quotations or sayings; they’re part of a unified Scripture, the living Word of God, woven from history, prophecy, literature, and episteles. To truly understand a verse, we must read it in context. With this in mind, these verses, viewed within their broader narrative, have deeply impacted me.
