Words possess the power to create, inspire, pacify, soothe, liberate, and educate. They help us grasp the complexities of reality, both physical and metaphysical. Whenever I come across a word I admire, I append it to my list and make a conscious effort to remember its meaning and usage. Each of these words feels like a precious gem, empowering me for self-expression, hopefully, towards the good. I hope you discover a new word today!
