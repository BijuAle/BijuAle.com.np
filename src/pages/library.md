I have a deep love for physical books. Reading books plays a vital role in my journey of lifelong learning, and stepping into libraries and book stores give me a kind of wholesome and cosy feeling. Over the past decade, I’ve carefully curated these books from diverse and even queer places. Some are treasures, I’ve rescued from the brink of oblivion—salvaged from trash heaps and plucked out from recycling bins. Other rarities I’ve unearthed in obscure thrift stores and some procured from across the continents. On rare occasions, a book I’ve been seeking seems to appear out of nowhere in the most unexpected of places, as if it found me. It is a miracle and I believe in God's providence and interventions. Each book in my collection carries its own story, making the journey to find it just as meaningful as the pages within.

I have employed the Dewey Decimal Classification System to categorize and track my collection. In the TOC, the first three digit on the left is the DDC code followed by the DDC category heading. The number to the right inside parenthesis for each heading is the count of the books under that category.

I hope you spot something interesting here. If you need any book(s) for reading or research, please write to me.
