My name is _Biju Ale_. I am a John 3:16 Christian with a deep interest in Philosophy, Theology, and Science. Welcome to my webpage—a space for thoughtful reflections. I hope you discover something meaningful here that resonates with you.

Presently, I support a consulting firm called [Scott Wilson Nepal](https://swnepal.com.np/biju-ale/), in research, monitoring, learning, and evaluation of myriad developmental projects in Nepal. <details class="details-animated ">

<summary>More about me...</summary>

- I support humanitarian and educational causes.

- I believe that naturalism, scientism, postmodernism, and critical theory are flawed worldviews.

- Some of my favorite authors are C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, Richard Swinburne, Pascal, William Lane Craig, and J.P. Moreland.

- Some of my favorite bands and arists are Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Elizabeth Cotten, Kenny G, Creed, Evanescence, Symphony X, Seventh Wonder, War of Ages, Stravinsky, and Beethoven.

- My favorite guitarists are Buckethead, Michael Romeo, and Mark Tremonti.

- Some of my favorite shows are Batman: The Animated Series (1992), X-Men (1992), Full House (1987), Freaks and Geeks (1999), and Robert L. Kuhn’s Closer to Truth.

- I’m nostalgic for the charm of the ’90s and early 2000s—if only we could freeze in its cosy zeitgeist!

- I also enjoy hiking, cycling, photography, playing the guitar, and creative projects in art, craft, and lettering.

- I’m a dog lover.
