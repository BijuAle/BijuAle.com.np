## About Me

My name is _Biju Ale_. I am a John 3:16 Christian with a deep interest in Philosophy, Theology, and Science. This is my website.

Presently, I support a consulting firm called [Scott Wilson Nepal](https://swnepal.com.np/biju-ale/), working in research, monitoring, learning, and evaluation of developmental projects in Nepal.
