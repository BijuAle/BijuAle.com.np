I, _Biju Ale_, am a John 3:16 Christian. I am interested in Philosophy, Theology, and Science. Welcome to my website, where I try to write about my formative experiences and occasional musings, and share .

Presently, I support a consulting firm called [Scott Wilson Nepal](https://swnepal.com.np/biju-ale/), in research, monitoring, learning, and evaluation of myriad developmental projects in Nepal. <details class="details-animated ">

<summary>More about me...</summary>

- I support humanitarian and educational causes.
- I believe naturalism, scientism, postmodernism, and critical theories are false worldviews.
- I love dogs.
- Some favourite authors: CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Richard Swinburne, Pascal, William L Craig, & J P Moreland.
- Some favourite musicians: Symphony X, Creed, Buckethead, Kenny G, Stravinsky, & Beethoven.
- My favorite shows are Batman Animated Series (1992), X-Men (1992), Full house (1987), Freaks & Geeks (1999), and Robert L. Kuhn's Closer to Truth.
- I am nostalgic about the lovely 90s and the early 2000s. Would it be possible bring 'em back and live in one?
- I also love to hike, bicycle, take pictures, play the guitar, and art-related activities: art, craft, and lettering.
