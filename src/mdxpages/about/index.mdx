# ABOUT

![Biju and group in Dhading](./biju.png)

Welcome to my website. Thanks for stopping by :) Here, I write about my formative experiences and occasional musings.

My name is _Biju Ale_. I am a Jesus-loving millennial, hailing from Nepal. Adhering to the Christian worldview, I believe in the objectivity of Truth, Morality, & Beauty. I am highly interested in Philosophy and Analytic Theology.

Presently, I support a consulting firm called [Scott Wilson Nepal](https://swnepal.com.np/biju-ale/), in research, monitoring, learning, and evaluation of myriad developmental projects.
