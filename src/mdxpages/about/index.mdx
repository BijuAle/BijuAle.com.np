<AboutImage />

Welcome to my blog. Thanks for stopping by :) My name is Biju Ale. I am a Jesus-loving Millenial, hailing from Nepal. I have warranted belief in the Christian worldview. I believe in objective Truth, beauty, &, morality. I am interested in Philosophy, Theology, & the Sciences.

I created this personal blog to journal & share with my loved ones, my journey's significant & formative moments, my musings alike. I also post educational content that could be of interest & insight, to the readers. The overall aim is to hone my critical thinking, creativity, writing, & communication skills. Also, to emanate, hope, inspiration, delight, warranted-true-beliefs, & beauty among friends, family, & associates alike.

# Hobbies

I love to travel, take pictures (Sans a dedicated/pro camera; I've been employing my battered but steadfast iPhone 4s, since 2012), arts and crafts, cycling (I rode a hardtail - 'Trek 4900' - daily ~20km for over 6 years, but sadly am now parted with it), & hiking. I love to uplift the deprived & the minorities around me, to the best of my ability & degree. I love Dogs very much. I am an aesthete. I love to watch old classic flicks akin to Hitchcock's. My favorite shows are Batman, X-Men, Full house, Freaks & Geeks, and Robert L. Kuhn's Close To Truth. I miss the beloved 90s.

I adore music by Stravinsky, Beethoven, Symphony X, Creed, Buckethead, Kenny G, & Karna Das (a legendary Nepali singer). Some of my favorite authors are Dostoyevsky, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Richard Swinburne, William L Craig, & R Zacharias.

# Aversions

Some things I avert and abhor (not in particulat order): postmodernism, scientism, jingoism, cronyism, logical fallacies, discrimination, despotism, radicalism, collusion, & sin.
