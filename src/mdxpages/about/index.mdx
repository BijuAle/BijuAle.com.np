<AboutImage />

Welcome to my blog. Thanks for stopping by :) My name is Biju Ale. I am a Jesus-loving Millenial, hailing from Nepal. Adhering to the Christian worldview, I believe in the objectivity of Truth, Morality, & Beauty. I am interested in Philosophy, Theology, & Sciences.

I created the blog to journal my musings and formative moments so that I can share them with my loved ones. I also post educational content that general readers may find interesting & insightful.

<summary>More about me..</summary>

# Hobbies

I love to travel, take pictures (with my steadfast phone), arts and crafts, cycling (I rode a hardtail - 'Trek 4900' - daily ~20km for over six years), & hiking. I side by the marginalized, minorities, and the deprived and strive to empower them to the best of my ability. I love dogs very much. I am an aesthete. I love to watch old classic flicks akin to Hitchcock's. My favorite shows are Batman, X-Men, Full house, Freaks & Geeks, and Robert L. Kuhn's Closer to Truth. I miss the beloved 90s.

I adore music by Stravinsky, Beethoven, Symphony X, Creed, Buckethead, Kenny G, & Karna Das (a legendary Nepali singer). Some of my favorite authors are Dostoyevsky, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Richard Swinburne, William L Craig, & R Zacharias.

# Aversions

Some things I avert and abhor: postmodernism, scientism, jingoism, cronyism, logical fallacies, discrimination, despotism, radicalism, collusion, & sin.
