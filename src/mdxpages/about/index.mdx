<AboutImage />

Welcome to my blog. Thanks for stopping by :) My name is Biju Ale. I am a Jesus-loving Millenial, hailing from Nepal. I am interested in Philosophy, Theology, the Sciences, & human welfare.

I created this personal blog to journal & share with my loved ones, my journey's formative significant moments. And To hone my critical thinking, creativity, writing, & communication skills. Also, to emanate, hope, inspiration, delight, warranted-true-beliefs, & beauty among friends, family, & associates alike.

# Hobbies

I love to travel, take pictures (Sans a dedicated/pro camera; I've been employing my battered but steadfast iPhone 4s, since 2012), arts and crafts, cycling (I rode a hardtail - 'Trek 4900' - daily ~20km for over 5 years, but sadly am now parted with it), & hiking. I love to volunteer for social cause. I love Dogs very much. I am an aesthete. I love to watch old classic flicks akin to Hitchcock's. My favorite shows are Batman, X-Men, Full house, Freaks & Geeks, and Robert L. Kuhn's Close To Truth. I miss the beloved 90s. Some things I avert and abhor: postmodernism, scientism, jingoism, cronyism, logical fallacies, discrimination, despotism, radicalism, & sin.

I adore music by Stravinsky, Beethoven, Symphony X, Creed, Buckethead, Kenny G, & Karna Das (a legendary Nepali singer). Some of my favorite authors are Dostoyevsky, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Richard Swinburne, William L Craig, & R Zacharias.
