Dear Astha,

We completed our activities for the day; distributed the Agriculture Infographic (AI) calendar to 56 HH in Pipal dada. Kristian couldn’t come with us. He had diarrhea yesterday night. And also needed time to recuperate from yesterday’s hard work (destoning schoolyard – involved stone lifting) at the Fajimtar school. So he rested today. He is fine now, nothing serious. Johan is still recovering, he too didn’t join us. Others including me went to the field at 8 am & returned at 2 pm. We had packed some snacks with us as I mentioned yesterday. Some banana, noodles, crackers, cucumbers, & water.

Today we did well. Ksitiz said Johan is feeling a lot better & looks forward to joining us all for tomorrow’s activity – decorating & cleaning the Panchaling school. AN’s finance person called me & said that the supplies were procured for tomorrow. I asked him to drop them at the school by today evening asap. They have agreed – need to check on that (& on the plantation supplies too) Well, they couldn’t get us the self-standing ladders & suggested we use the local ladders. But that’s okay. They’ve got most of the things like paints, brushes and masks and gloves. Also some added things we hadn’t asked for but is useful nevertheless. The paraffin oil & sandpapers. I think it will be fine.

I heard you’ve dropped the medkit along with the water purification at Tassia-Ankit’s. Thank you. Also I’ve informed everyone on the group photo. But its quite difficult to get one. We are situated in separate locations with different action plans & its hard to meet. But I will ensure that will the GP be the first priority once we all converge. Perhaps on a common activity, we have or even sooner. Tassia is doing fine. She needs rest after today’s long hike under the scorching heat. We took plenty of rest on our way. She also needs some protein in her diet, she was saying. Kristian & I couldn’t take the shower today. Our host family dai is fixing/cleaning the source. Tomorrow we can do it. They said they will also set up a tarpaulin covering in the open bathing area. So that’s fine.

The rest is good Astha. I hope our friends at Fajimtar are doing well too. Until next time.

Regards,  
Biju
