Back in 2018, in college, I had established a philosophical student society. The idea was to host daily assemblies and open forums to discuss about philosophical topics as well as on other domains such as current affairs, and writing.

[Here](https://bit.ly/SocietyOEK) is the archived wesbite of the society.
