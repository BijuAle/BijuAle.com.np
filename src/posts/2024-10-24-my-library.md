I have a deep love for physical books. Over the past decade, I’ve meticulously and vigilantly curated my collection from diverse and queer places. Some are treasures, I’ve rescued from the brink of oblivion—salvaged from trash heaps and plucked out from recycling bins. Other rarities I’ve unearthed in obscure thrift stores and some procured from across the continents. On rare occasions, a book I’ve been seeking seems to appear out of nowhere in the most unexpected of places, as if it found me. It is a miracle and I believe in God's providence and interventions. Each book in my collection carries its own story, making the journey to find it just as meaningful as the pages within.

I have employed the Dewey Classification System to categorize and track my collection. Use the TOC below to view a specific category. In the TOC, the first three digit on the left is the DDC code followed by the DDC category heading. The grey number to the right inside parenthesis for each heading is the count of the books in my library under that category.

The cataloging is ongoing...
