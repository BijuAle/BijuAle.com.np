We were asked by the state-owned radio broadcasting organization, 'Radio Nepal' for our opinions as part of their vox pop section for the news. The query was whether the Nepali state has been championing for the masses, the rule of law in light of the recent apprehension of the Nepali Congress leader, and now suspended lawmaker Mohammad Aftab Alam.

Alam was indicted for orchestrating the macabre carnage of at least 18 persons in Rautahat district on the eve of the first constituent assembly election, over a decade ago.
