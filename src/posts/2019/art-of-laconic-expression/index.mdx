> So avoid using the word ‘very’ because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don’t use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won’t do in your essays.

<cite>Mr. Keating, Dead Poets Society</cite>

Regardless of wooing the women part, the important part here is the heads up, 'it won't do in your essays'.

"Very" is one of the overly used adverbs. That play was very interesting. The Korean food was very delicious. Her eyes were closed, and she seemed very calm. And when "very" just doesn't cut it, you'll find "extremely". "Very" is often used in an attempt to intensify the meaning. Rather this approach backfires by diluting the sentence with wordiness.
