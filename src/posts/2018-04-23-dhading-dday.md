Dear Astha,

Yesterday, Kristian, Johan, Ksitiz, Ankit, Tassia, and I conducted a field survey at the primary school in Panchaling. We demarcated the land and identified plant species that could help reduce the risk of landslides. At first, we faced some difficulty contacting the Action Nepal representative for the activity because his name was incorrectly listed in the contact sheet we were given. Despite that, we carried out the task independently, and it went very well.

We also met with the principal and discussed a future activity focused on classroom decoration and cleaning. In the evening, we held a meeting at my home and prepared an order list of materials required for the plantation and classroom activities, including paints and protective gear, and sent it to Action Nepal. Ganesh ji informed me that he would consult his team and respond early the next morning. However, I did not receive a reply. When I called him later today, he mentioned that they are trying to procure the materials, but not all requested items may be available. He specifically said that certain fruit bearing saplings such as mango, peach, and litchi would not be provided. This was disappointing because we had developed a comprehensive plan to include several locally suitable species to help mitigate landslides. We were informed that only two plant species would be supplied. He said he would update both our group and the Fajimtar group on the order status. We require all materials before the activity scheduled for Wednesday.

Today we distributed the agriculture information calendar to 45 households. Johan and Ksitiz were unable to join us. We began the day from Ankit’s home. Before starting our activity, a doctor visited Tassia and diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection. She has been experiencing blood in her urine and has been prescribed medication. Her other vital signs are stable, and her endurance has not been affected. She continues to work with us. The doctor also examined Johan and prescribed medication for him. He has a bacterial ear infection and has not been sleeping or eating well. He rested today, with Ksitiz staying back to look after him.

After that, we carried out the calendar distribution, which went smoothly and was completed earlier than expected. Since we finished early, we went down the hill to assist the Fajimtar group with preparations for their school cleaning activity. Due to our different placements and action plans, we rarely meet, so it was good to connect today. The work was physically demanding as we had to remove stones from the school grounds to make the area safe for children. Jacqueline managed the task very effectively and showed particular dedication toward school related activities. We were somewhat surprised by the limited coordination and delayed updates from Action Nepal, both at the headquarters and field levels. Nonetheless, the work progressed well. Romisha mentioned that she may need to return to Kathmandu for a viva examination.

The Panchaling group returned home exhausted and covered in dust. Tassia, Kristian, and I urgently need a shower, but we must leave early tomorrow morning for another round of distribution. Since we cannot return for lunch due to the long hike and will leave at 7 am, we plan to carry bananas and crackers with us again.

Action Nepal has still not provided our identification cards, phone credits, printed maps, or water purification supplies. It has been three days now.

In summary, we have been carrying out our responsibilities effectively. Johan remains unwell and has not been able to join field activities. Tassia is recovering and continues to hike with us. Kristian is in excellent health and has strong endurance. I have had no health issues. During our leisure time, we read and spend time speaking with our host family. Kristian and I get along very well. He is humble, knowledgeable, and deeply interested in Buddhism and Tibetan studies. Our host family has been very kind and has taken good care of us. The food and accommodation are comfortable. I am not aware of any issues faced by the others in their respective households.

There is no internet connection here, and our schedule is quite demanding, which makes it difficult to send frequent updates. There is much happening that I wish I could share in detail. I will try to remain consistent with updates and inform you promptly about any urgent matters. Overall, this has been a very meaningful and enriching experience.

Take care,
Biju
